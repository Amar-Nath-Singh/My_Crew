# My_Crew

**My_Crew** is a cutting-edge **Customer Service LLM Swarm Architecture** designed to automate service tasks using Large Language Model (LLM) agents with advanced reasoning and autonomy capabilities. This project introduces a robust framework for agent-to-agent interaction and function calling to improve service task efficiency.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ **Agent Swarm Architecture**
- **Base LLM:** Deployed **Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct** with Q4_0 quantization, supporting up to **128K context windows**.
- **Hardware Setup:** Optimized to run on **2x Nvidia T4 GPUs** for efficient and scalable performance.

### ðŸ›  **Reasoning and Automation**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompts:** Enhanced reasoning capabilities through structured CoT prompting.
- **Tool Calling:** Automated task execution using tools like MySQL queries, DuckDuckGo searches, and task planning.
- **Agent-to-Agent Interaction:** Improved autonomy with a robust interaction chain.

### ðŸ“Š **Graph-Based Agent Interaction**
- Introduced a **graph-based framework** to enable collaboration between agents with distinct expertise, such as:
  - **Database Management:** MySQL Query Execution
  - **Information Retrieval:** DuckDuckGo Search
  - **Task Planning:** Autonomous decision-making and planning

## Use Cases

- **Customer Service Automation:** Automate complex customer queries by delegating tasks to specialized LLM agents.
- **Data Management:** Efficiently query and manipulate databases with natural language instructions.
- **Information Retrieval:** Perform quick and accurate searches using DuckDuckGo and similar tools.
- **Planning and Scheduling:** Delegate and plan tasks autonomously using an interconnected swarm of LLM agents.

## Future Enhancements

- Extend the toolset with integrations for APIs like GPT, AWS, or Azure.
- Improve graph-based agent interaction with dynamic learning from tasks.
- Support for multi-GPU setups and larger models for advanced use cases.
